<!--
This file demonstrates how to use a shared configuration file. In this
case the absolute path of the file is /shared/config.js. Shared 
configuration can be used to ensure:
a) A version of the applications configuration is bundled with the app  
   at build time - i.e. the locally included config.js file
b) The latest version of the applications configuration can be loaded 
   using a cloud action call

To fully appreciate local vs cloud config: build this app and install it on a 
device. Once installed, change the contents of the config variable in config.js 
from within the Studio and click the button to "Execute cloud action call" in 
the app on the device. 
Notice how the config returned from the cloud action call reflects the changes 
just made, while the local config remain static. Using this method, you can keep 
your apps updated with new configuration information without the need to publish  
a new app to the app store.

<p> Click on the button below to make a cloud "action" call which will return 
  the latest configuration information from the shared config.js file</p>

<button id='run_button'> Execute cloud action call </button>

<!-- Include the config.js file from the shared directory 
(as if it was in the local directory) -->

<!-- include the init.js file from within the default package -->

<!-- 
The client directory contains all files which may be included when an app is 
built.

The client directory is divided into "packages" - incremental units of 
functionality and configuration.

Every app will always include the files within the "default" package - 
represented by the path /client/default/ - i.e. the directory containing this 
file.

New packages can be defined by creating additional directories within the client
directory. To associate a particular package with a destination (iPhone, iPad, 
Android etc), add the "package" (i.e. directory) name to the packages field 
within the configuration section of the studio. 

Multiple packages can be associated with a destination by adding multiple package
names - separated by spaces - to the packages field in the configuration section.
If multiple packages are defined, the packages are applied incrementally - i.e. 
if the same file exists in multiple packages the order that the packages are 
listed will determine which package the file is pulled from. The package names 
are listed in order of significance with the most significant package name listed 
first. 

The contents of the default package are always included as the least significant 
package.
